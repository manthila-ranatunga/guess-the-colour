# Guess the Colour Game
I made this to practice my Javascript skills as I'm starting out. This is my 3rd Javascript project.

# Instructions
The player has to guess the colour displayed by the RGB values by clicking on the correct one out of the three coloured squares. The RGB value is generated randomly, and assigned to one of the 3 squares randomly. The other two squares' colours are also generated randomly but are close to the correct colour to make the game a little challenging.

Press "New Game" to start a new game whic resets the streak. Choosing the correct colour as displayed by the RGB values increases the streak by 1, and a new round starts. Selecting the wrong colour resets the streak to 0. The game keeps track of the highest streak, lost only when refreshing the page.
